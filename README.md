`python3: can't open file FILENAME: [Errno 2] No such file or directory`

Possible reasons:
* The spelling of the filename is incorrect. Check and rectify as appropriate.
* The path to the file is incorrect. Move to the directory containing the file by using the command `cd` and try again, or type in the full path of the file from the current working directory.
